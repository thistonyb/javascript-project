JavaScript-Project AKA MealVoter is a SPA to help families/friends decide on what meal they should eat together.

Description: Currently MealVoter is a simple single page application utilizing Rails as the backend and JavaScript as the front end. The app allows the user to create a means for their family or friends to vote on meal options. We all have been in a position where it feels like pulling teeth to decide on what a group should eat. With that inspiration in mind MealVoter was created. A user can create a new Meal with a Date and then tack on meal Options. The app allows for seven Options to be created and then votes to be cast on each individual Option. Whatever Option gets them most votes wins!
